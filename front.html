<header><p style="color: #3C1414;text-align:left;font-family:Impact;font-size:40px;">General Blood & Platelet Donor Guidelines</p></header><br><br>

<header><p style="color:red;text-align:left;font-family:Wide Latin;font-size:25px;">Why to donate?</p></header>


<p style="color:black;text-align:left;font-family:Constantia;font-size:20px;">1. It saves lives, what else do you need to know?<br><br>
2. It is not more painful then losing a loved one that you may save by donating!<br><br>
3. It is your civic duty.<br><br>
4. Because I know too many people who can’t give blood.<br><br>
5. Because some day, I may need someone to do the same for me.<br><br>
6. Do unto others, as you would have them do unto you!<br><br>
7. Because if you need blood one day, you would not hesitate to take it, so why would you hesitate to give it?<br><br>
8. Blood donation is important because maintaining an adequate blood supply in our community secures blood transfusions for patients.<br><br>
9. It gives donors a medical check at no cost. <br><br>
10. Free cookies, juice and the satisfaction of helping others.<br><br>
11. I can’t discover a cure for cancer, but I can help keep someone alive while they are waiting for a cure.<br><br></p>



<header><p style="color:red;text-align:left;font-family:Impact;font-size:25px;">Why Guidelines Are Important?</p></header>


<p style="color:black;text-align:left;font-family:Constantia;font-size:20px;">Donor eligibility rules help to protect the health and safety of the donor as well as the person who will receive a blood transfusion. The general guidelines listed below will help you determine if you are eligible to donate blood or platelets.<br><br>
</p>

<header><p style="color:red;text-align:left;font-family:Impact;font-size:25px;">You and Your Donation Are Important to Us.</p></header>


<p style="color:black;text-align:left;font-family:Constantia;font-size:20px;">Before donating, one of our medical professionals will discuss your health history with you in a private, confidential setting. After taking your pulse, blood pressure, and temperature and checking for anemia, we will determine whether you are eligible to be a donor.<br><br></p>

<header><p style="color:red;text-align:left;font-family:Impact;font-size:25px;">General Guidelines</p></header>


<p style="color:black;text-align:left;font-family:Constantia;font-size:20px;">To donate blood or platelets, you must be in good general health, weigh at least 110 pounds, and be at least 16 years old. Parental consent is required for blood donation by 16 year olds; 16 year olds are NOT eligible to donate platelets. No parental consent is required for those who are at least 17 years old. If you are 76 or older, you will need your doctor’s written approval for blood or platelet donation.<br><br>
</p>

<header><p style="color:red;text-align:left;font-family:Impact;font-size:25px;">What Is ‘Good’ Health?
</p></header>


<p style="color:black;text-align:left;font-family:Constantia;font-size:20px;">Good health means that you feel well and are able to carry out normal daily activities. If you have a chronic medical condition such as diabetes or high blood pressure, you may still be eligible as long as you are receiving treatment to control your condition.<br><br>
</p>

<header><p style="color:red;text-align:left;font-family:Impact;font-size:25px;">Needed Identification
</p></header>


<p style="color:black;text-align:left;font-family:Constantia;font-size:20px;">We require that you provide identification that shows your name and your photograph or signature.
</p>

<header><p style="color:red;text-align:left;font-family:Impact;font-size:25px;">What Conditions Would Make You Ineligible to Be a Donor?
</p></header>


<p style="color:black;text-align:left;font-family:Constantia;font-size:20px;">You will not be eligible to donate blood or platelets if you:<br><br>

1. Have tested positive for hepatitis B or hepatitis C, lived with or had sexual contact in the past 12 months with anyone who has hepatitis B or symptomatic hepatitis C.<br><br>
2. Had a tattoo in the past 12 months or received a blood transfusion (except with your own blood) in the past 12 months.<br><br>
3. Have ever had a positive test for the AIDS virus.<br><br>
4. Have ever used intravenous illegal drugs, even once.<br><br>
5. Have ever used injectable drugs, including anabolic steroids, unless prescribed by a physician.<br><br>
